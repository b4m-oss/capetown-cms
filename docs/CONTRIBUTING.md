## What Does It Mean to Contribute? Definition of Contributions to Capetown CMS

We believe that contributing to open source software can take many forms, and all of them are valuable.

1. **Use the Product**: Using the product is the first step in contributing. This is a great initial contribution.
2. **Say Something Online**: Expressing your opinion is encouraged, even if it may be difficult for us to hear.
3. **Help Someone**: If someone needs help with the product, any support is welcome, even if it doesn't fully resolve their issue.
4. **Maintain Documentation**: Maintaining documentation is just as important as maintaining the product itself. It is a truly noble action.
5. **Translating and Adapting to Your Culture**: Great software should be accessible worldwide, including translations of documentation.
6. **Coding**: Updating code, creating new features, and fixing bugs represent the highest level of contribution to the product.

## Contributor Duties

**Definition of a Contributor**: A contributor is anyone who engages in any of the activities listed in points 1 to 6 above.

### Difference Between Issues and Discussions

Issues serve as a to-do list and are not the place for discussions.

For example, feature requests, unexpected behavior, user opinions, and development directions should be posted and discussed at [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/kohki-shikata/capetown-cms/discussions).

Users can open issues, but depending on the content, the issue may be moved from Issues to Discussions.
